This is an old version, where some steps were automated, but the DYNAMOS pods were stuck in a loop of creating, running, completed, with Back-off along the way sometimes as well. However, the pods were meant to be running without completing, since it was a deployment (e.g. policy, orchestrator, api-gateway, etc.). This was likely something that was caused by the Jupyter Hub notebook environment shells that did not work, since manually executing the files did work. Or something that was unstable in DYNAMOS or Kubernetes and the way it works. Therefore, this is saved as a backup, but it is not yet fully working with the above problem and the current setup uses manual steps.
