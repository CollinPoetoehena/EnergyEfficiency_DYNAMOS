# Deploying other components
Run the script file to deploy the components:
```sh
# Go to the scripts path
cd cd energy-efficiency/scripts/
# Make the script executable (probably only needs to be done once)
chmod +x deployComponents.sh
# Execute the script with the charts path, such as:
./deployComponents.sh /mnt/c/Users/cpoet/IdeaProjects/EnergyEfficiency_DYNAMOS/charts
```
