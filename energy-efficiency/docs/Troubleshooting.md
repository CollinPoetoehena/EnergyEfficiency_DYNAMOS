# Infinite loading with local Kubernetes (e.g. Grafana or other Kubernetes related sources)
This can sometimes happen. You can either take a break and see if it still is loading after 15 minutes. Otherwise, you can try another solution:

The solution is to stop the Kubernetes cluster with:
```sh 
minikube stop
```

And then rerun it
```sh
minikube start
```
Possibly also restarting other things, such as forwarding Grafana.

# Grafana (or other forwarded port taking too long)
```sh
E0626 17:29:45.184192   11096 portforward.go:351] error creating error stream for port 3000 -> 3000: Timeout occurred
```
This is an example of the error that can occur when the loading takes too long
