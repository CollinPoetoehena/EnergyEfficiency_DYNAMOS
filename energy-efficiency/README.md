# Energy Efficiency in DYNAMOS
Project for Collin Poetoehena's Master thesis on energy efficiency in DYNAMOS.

## Running python scripts
Navigate to the energy-efficiency folder and run the main python file:
```sh
# Navigate to energy-efficiency folder
cd energy-efficiency

# Run specific script 
python main.py
```
Running the scripts from this location is crucial, since the imports are assuming the scripts are run from this location.

## Getting Started
- [Getting Started with DYNAMOS](docs/getting-started/0_Getting-Started.md)

# TODO: create the documentation for the files in the docs folder.
