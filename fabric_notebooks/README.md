FABRIC recommends using Jupyter Notebook for interacting with FABRIC, which is where this folder comes into play. This folder contains the notebooks that can be used for DYNAMOS in FABRIC specifically. Managing these notebooks in version control allows for easy management and version histories. These notebooks can be added in the Jupyter Hub in FABRIC: https://learn.fabric-testbed.net/article-categories/jupyter-hub/.
